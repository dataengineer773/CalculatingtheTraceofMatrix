We need to calculate the trace of a matrix, The Solution is Use trace, The trace of a matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements and is often used under the hood in machine learning methods. Given a NumPy multidimensional array, we can calculate the trace using trace. We
can also return the diagonal of a matrix and calculate its sum.
